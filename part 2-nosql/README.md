# Part 2: NoSQL Database (MongoDB)

## Objective
This module demonstrates the conceptual understanding of NoSQL databases
and MongoDB for managing semi-structured product catalog data in FlexiMart.

---

## Deliverables

### 1. nosql_analysis.md
- Type: Theory Report
- Status: Completed
- Description:
  Contains a three-section theoretical analysis covering:
  - Introduction to NoSQL and MongoDB
  - SQL vs NoSQL comparison for product catalogs
  - Advantages of MongoDB for flexible and scalable systems

---

### 2. mongodb_operations.js
- Type: Practical Implementation
- Status: Partially Completed
- Description:
  This file is intended to contain MongoDB CRUD and aggregation operations.
  Due to MongoDB environment/setup issues on the local system,
  full execution and validation of practical operations could not be completed.
  The file structure and commands are prepared as per assignment requirements.

### 3. products_catalog.json
- Type: Sample Data
- Description:
  Contains sample product catalog data in JSON format, structured to support
  MongoDB document-based storage and aggregation queries.

## Evaluation Criteria Alignment

### Theory Report (10 Marks)
- Conceptual clarity
- Logical structure
- Proper explanation of NoSQL and MongoDB use cases

➡ Addressed in `nosql_analysis.md`

---

### MongoDB Operations (10 Marks)
- CRUD and aggregation operations
- Proper syntax and comments

➡ Partially addressed due to technical limitations

---

## Conclusion
This part demonstrates a strong theoretical understanding of MongoDB
and NoSQL concepts. Practical implementation could not be fully completed
due to local MongoDB configuration issues, but the design and approach
align with the required objectives of the assignment.
